 Question1
 Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest
  boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. 
  Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements 
  that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). 
  It can be proven that there is a unique answer. Return the root of the trimmed 
  binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.
